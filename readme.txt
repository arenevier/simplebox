SimpleBox is a javascript library to display modal elements in a web page. It's
basically yet another [lightbox-clone][1]. It can be used to display any html
content in a modal box. It can work with images, but also with videos, forms,
etc.

You can personalize methods used to close simplebox with argument options.
SimpleBox fires custom events when simplebox is shown or hidden:
_simplebox:shown_ and _simplebox:hidden_ respectively.
